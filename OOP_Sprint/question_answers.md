**What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
when others do the same for your code?**

When reviewing code it is important to pay close attention to the indentation
of code blocks especially the internal consistency of optional practices such
as the spacing of conditional statements. Line length is also an important
facet of reviewing code. Increasingly mobile devices are being used to write
and review code for productions use and lines with more than 79 characters can
make reading code a hassle.

**We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
improve this situation?**

Containers in addition to keeping the dev-ops team from developing
destabilizing mental conditions enable a company to ensure reproducibility at
a large scale. The minimal virtual operating system run by a container enables
lightweight and reproducible processes to be run for product support, analysis
or even full production in which clusters of containers can be used to
partition the product for different use cases.
